# Hypercube (Factorio mod)

A work-in-progress Factorio overhaul mod for Factorio that reworks the game in a way that feels rather different from the base game or other overhaul mods.

## Compatibility

This is an overhaul mod and removes most standard items, so it's unlikely to be compatible with any other mod that adds new recipes and hasn't been specifically adapted to work with it.

Built-in support for some popular mods that add small numbers of recipes will probably come at some point, but isn't a priority yet.

## Dependencies

Depends on [Krastorio2Assets](https://github.com/raiguard/Krastorio2Assets) for additonal graphics and sounds. Does not depend on [Krastorio2](https://github.com/raiguard/Krastorio2) itself, but contains modified versions of some of its prototype definitions. Both mods are licensed under the GNU GPLv3. Many thanks to the Krastorio 2 developers for their work and for making this possible.
