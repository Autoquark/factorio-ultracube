# Hypercube (Factorio mod)

A work-in-progress overhaul mod for Factorio.

This mod is rather more difficult than vanilla Factorio, but in a way that feels fairly different from many other overhaul mods.

It doesn't add huge numbers of intermediate products or require complex recipes to produce basic logistics and production machines.

Instead, the player starts with a single extremely useful cube (additional copies cannot be crafted), required as a catalyst in various large bulk-processing steps for raw materials.

As a result, significant portions of the factory resist copy-paste expansion and can be made more productive only by solving logistical problems, making design improvements, or unlocking new technologies. At any given level of technological progress there exists some theoretical upper limit on the total net output of the factory, but getting close to this limit will be tricky.

The need to intelligently route the single catalyst where it's needed presents an interesting logistical puzzle unique to this mod. The circuit network will likely prove a necessity for full automation, even in the relatively early game; the focus on high-volume bulk recipes that run only sporadically makes the the production process feel quite different, and means planning the factory is rarely as simple as plugging throughput numbers into a calculator.

## Compatibility

This is an overhaul mod that removes many standard ingredients from the game, so it's unlikely to be compatible with any other mod that adds new recipes and hasn't been specifically adapted to work with it.

Built-in support for some popular mods that add small numbers of recipes will probably come at some point, but isn't a priority yet.

## Dependencies and credits

This mod depends on [Krastorio2Assets](https://github.com/raiguard/Krastorio2Assets) for additonal graphics and sounds. It doesn't depend on [Krastorio2](https://github.com/raiguard/Krastorio2) itself, but contains modified versions of some of its prototype definitions. Both mods are licensed under the GNU GPLv3. Many thanks to the Krastorio 2 developers for their work and for making this possible.
